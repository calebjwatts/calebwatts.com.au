```javascript
console.log('Hello World!')
```

Well as every person in tech eventually does I'm starting to blog. Now this isn't actually the first blog I have made, my true fans may remember my initial, ill-fated attempt, *Just Another Hacker Blog*. Whilst I am proud of the little website I made using Jekyll, it did not recieve the care and attention it deserved from me. I retired that blog early this year, and am now making my second attempt at a digital stream of conciousness.

I plan to use this blog to post about cool stuff. Whether that is my escapades in cyber space, a cool piece of work I have done, or my general ponderances about the meaning of life, the universe, and everything. My posts will vary in length and writing quality, but hopefully it'll remain an interesting body of work for you to read at your leisure.

I hope to dedicate a bit of time at least weekly to post, though as a uni student facing the realities of being an adult for the first time I make no promises about adhering to this. Posts will be made when they are made, and I ask for your patience with me.

Cheers gang,

~ Caleb
