Hi there,

If you have made your way here you would know I'm Caleb, a 4th year Computer Science and Arts student running for the position of Undergraduate Student Representative on the Engineering Faculty board. The reason for this is simple, I think I have ideas and experience to bring to the table and can use to make things better for students in the Faculty.

If you want to know more about the experience I am bringing to the table you can check out my [about page](https://calebwatts.com.au/about) but I would like to focus more on what I'd like to do for you if I am elected.

### What I will try to do
I have four main goals for what I would like to accomplish if I am elected to the Engineering Faculty board, and they are: 
- More tutors for large courses in the Faculty
- Continued online or hybrid offerings for lectures, tutorials and labs
- Better support for students who work and study
- Stronger representation of students in decision-making

I recognise these are big goals so I would like to highlight why you should care about these issues

#### More tutors
I'm sure this is a common experience had by many of us, sitting in a tutorial or lab perhaps waiting to ask a question or to have a task reviewed. However, there are 30 other students also waiting and when the tutor gets to you they can only spare a couple of minutes to answer questions before they have to move on. Or, you have submitted an assessment task a few weeks ago and you are waiting for marks and feedback so that you can review and move on.

Annoying, right? 

We all know that this isn't the fault of our tutors, they are trying their best to help us learn but with larger and larger classes they have less and less time to spend helping us.

Having more tutors, particularly in larger courses, means our tutors have more time to teach us and go over the material we are struggling with. It means they are able to more quickly mark and provide feedback on assessments. It means a better learning environment for all of us.

#### Continued Online and Hybrid Offerings
Online and hybrid offerings have been a core part of our university experience since COVID and it has been key in improving accessibility to study for many. However you may have noticed that online lecture options, hybrid tutorials and labs have slowly been disapperaing from our Faculty.

Ensuring that these options remain is critical to keeping our Faculty accessible to all students.

#### Better support for students who work and study
Many students, including myself, work full or part time jobs in addition to studying. However often their is limited support or assistance for those of us who work to support ourselves.

Introducing more flexibility for students who work will make our Faculty more accessible and more equitable for all students.

#### Stronger representation of students in decision making
Students should be at the centre of the Faculty's decision-making. 

We are the ones most affected by decisions of the Faculty board so we deserve to have strong representation that listens to us. 

I hope to work with the amazing student representatives and societies within our Faculty to ensure that the needs of students are addressed. I also will commit to continued outreach to students across the faculty throughout the year.

Together, we can make the Faculty of Engineering an environment where every student has the opportunity to succeed and ensure every student's voice is heard. Your vote is a step towards making our Faculty more about us, the students.
