One of the many reasons for that is the sheer amount of customisability it offers. That’s why I like it anyway.\nIt also like many other text editors allows you to make custom ‘themes’ for it of which VS Code users have made thousands. Whilst many are happy to use an off the shelf theme, in making one for Galah Cyber, I began a very interesting process of customising and fine tuning a theme to fit ‘the look’ of Galah but also be a theme that people actually want to use.\nGetting started\u003e Getting started # To start, you need to have a few things installed:\nNode.js\nGit\nWith those things installed we can get going.\nFirst we need to install yo:\n$ npm install -g yo generator-code Next simply open a terminal and navigate to the directory you want your theme. Once there run:\n$ yo code This will start the Visual Studio Code Extension generator. using your arrow keys you can make a selection, we want a new color theme:\nOnce you select this, choose start fresh:\nThen we need to decide on a name, extension identifier (just use the default), a short description, display name, and the base theme (either the default light or dark theme).\nOnce you have made those decisions you will be given the option to initialise a git repository and open the project in VS Code.\nOnce this is done you will have a repository with a few different files.\nMaking your theme\u003e Making your theme # themes/your-color-theme.json\u003e themes/your-color-theme.json # This is the most important file in the project.\nThis is where you will decide on the colours you will use in your theme. Broadly this can be broken up into two main categories editor colours and workbench colours.\nEditor colours are all the colours in the text editor portion of VS Code. These are the colours you change if you want to alter your syntax highlighting. It is based off of an older text editor known as Textmate, which used scopes to define which parts of a language’s syntax would be coloured.\nWorkbench colours are all the other colours. It is the colour of buttons, menu selections and so on. Microsoft have a really helpful article which covers off on all of the parts of VS Code you can change with a theme extension.\nDeciding on colours\u003e Deciding on colours # This part is largely up to you and is the most time consuming part of the theme development process. Here are some tips I recommend you follow:\nMake it easy to read First and foremost, your text editor needs to be easy to read. There is no point developing a theme that is ultimately unusable because the colours are too similar and don’t provide enough contrast.\nTry reading a little colour theory This will help you pick colours that complement each other and help you make a beautiful theme. An article that I read when developing my theme emphasised this point and you can find it here.\nIf in doubt, test it out Test! If you are unsure about your colours you can always test them out. This will make it easier for you to identify whether your colours work together, and look the way you imagine them to.\nBut how do you test?\nTesting your theme\u003e Testing your theme # Testing your theme is a relatively simple process.\nOpen the project in VS Code and press F5 if on windows or fn + F5 if on MacOS. This will launch a new window with your theme.\nIn this mode you can also use a tool to help you identify what textmate scope is responsible for a certain colour in your editor.\nTo do this press ctrl + shift + p on windows or cmd + shift + p on MacOS and type in Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes. You can now select tokens in your editor and see their scopes.\nI suggest you make yourself a folder of code snippets from a wide range of different languages so that you can see how your theming looks in a range of scenarios. It is a painful thing to discover after putting in the hours to select a theme that works for one language, for it to not work for another entirely.\nInstalling your theme\u003e Installing your theme # Installing your theme locally is a simple process. Simply copy your repository from wherever you are developing to ~/.vscode/extensions/your-theme on Linux/MacOS or %USERPROFILE%\\.vscode\\extensions\\galah-theme on Windows. Once you have done that, you’re done and ready to use your theme.\nIf you want to publish your theme to the VS Code Marketplace, you can learn more about that here.\n","date":"15 November 2022","permalink":"/posts/making-your-own-vscode-theme/making-your-own-vscode-theme/","section":"Posts","summary":"Visual Studio Code has become prolific in the tech community as the text editor of choice for many.

It can be used to automate many tasks in the platform using events to begin some sequence of actions. This can be used to build and deploy your application on a pull into main, deploy a docker image to your infrastructure.\nThough before we get to using GitHub Actions, it\u0026rsquo;d be a good idea to learn a bit more about it\u0026rsquo;s anatomy.\nAnatomy of a Workflow\u003e Anatomy of a Workflow # Workflow\u003e Workflow # The workflow is the encompassing structure of an Action. It contains all of the elements of one, including events and the jobs that they trigger. A workflow is defined in a .yaml file in the .github/workflows directory of a repsoitory. You can have more than one in a repository enabling a fair amount of flexibility in how you can use them.\nEvents\u003e Events # A neat part of GitHub Actions is the amount of triggers, or Events that exist to start your Actions. For example you could run a workflow that adds important information whenever someone creates an issue, or tests a pull request whenever one is opened. This gives you quite a bit of versatility in your Actions, meaning you can use them beyond just devops operations.\nJobs\u003e Jobs # Jobs are the part of an action that does stuff. They are composed of a series of steps that are run either in parallel, or in order, depending on if a sxtep relies on one that proceeds it. Each step is either a script or an Action, so you are able to keep them simple, or make them as complex as you desire. A key thing to note is that all steps within a job run on the same runner, meaning that you can share data between steps allowing for more interesting and complex jobs.\nRunners\u003e Runners # Runners are servers that run a single job. GitHub provides a variety of different operating systems for runners, all of which execute in fresh virtual machines at runtime. If you have particular requirements for a runner you are also able to host your own.\nActions\u003e Actions # Actions are custom applications for the GitHub Actions feature. Much like a function they allow you to reuse a complex but repeatable action in your workflows. They are very powerful and can be used to do a number of different things. Actions can be custom built or can be selected from the GitHub Marketplace.\n","date":"15 November 2022","permalink":"/posts/github-actions-anatomy-of-a-workflow/","section":"Posts","summary":"GitHub\u0026rsquo;s automation feature GitHub Actions is a powerful devops automation tool built into GitHub.

Whilst I am proud of the little website I made using Jekyll, it did not recieve the care and attention it deserved from me. I retired that blog early this year, and am now making my second attempt at a digital stream of conciousness.\nI plan to use this blog to post about cool stuff. Whether that is my escapades in cyber space, a cool piece of work I have done, or my general ponderances about the meaning of life, the universe, and everything. My posts will vary in length and writing quality, but hopefully it\u0026rsquo;ll remain an interesting body of work for you to read at your leisure.\nI hope to dedicate a bit of time at least weekly to post, though as a uni student facing the realities of being an adult for the first time I make no promises about adhering to this. Posts will be made when they are made, and I ask for your patience with me.\nCheers gang,\n~ Caleb\n","date":"15 November 2022","permalink":"/posts/hello-world/","section":"Posts","summary":"console.log(\u0026#39;Hello World!\u0026#39;) Well as every person in tech eventually does I\u0026rsquo;m starting to blog.
